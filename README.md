# First-2D-Game
Game teaches the user about several searching/sorting algorithms as they play!

A: LEFT
D: RIGHT
SPACE: JUMP

For my twelfth grade computer science summative I decided to place my teacher as the main character in a game. The game teaches the user about searching and sorting in a friendly way. The main character is never allowed to die, so if he falls off the map then there is random dirt hovering in the air to protect him!

While you play the game it will randomly freeze, this just means that u need to answer a multiple choice question in the console. If you guess the multiple choice wrong then the array gets randomly generated again, and again, and... well.. again.. (supposed to make the question more challenging for future computer science students). 

There are only 2 questions; Uses Insertion sort and Bubble sort (shaker). The program actually sorts the arrays by itself using the actual algorithm. 

When you enter your name and then cancel the program it'll say, "Last Played: (name)". It saves a .txt file with the last played character! The last played character is "Obama" by default.   

The game is kinda boring with some bad art but that's okay, because Obama once told me, "Started from the bottom and now we are here".
